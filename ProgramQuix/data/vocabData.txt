Abstract Class
A class that cannot be instantiated.
Containment
Indicates a whole-part relationship and are known as "has-a" relationships. Also known as aggregation.
Algorithm
A procedure that can take input. Through computational steps the input is transformed into output.
Array
A fixed data structure that can hold a collection of elements (identified by index position).
Association
A generic relationship between two classes.
Base 10
A numeral system with 10 values (0-9).
Base 2
A numeral system with symbols that represent two values.
Binary
Relating to, or using, the base-2 numeral system (values are expressed with only two symbols: 0 and 1).
Bit
A single binary number.
Boolean
A data type with a binary value (such as: true or false, 1 or 0, or on and off).
Byte
Eight bits (8 bits can hold one of 256 values (from 0-255).
Character
A data type that stores a single character, and in C# is surrounded by single quote marks: 'c'.
Class
A template of a type of object.
Class Diagram
Used to design or model the class structure in a system, including properties and methods.
Code Block
A statement or statements enclosed in curly braces {}. It can contain nested blocks.
Compiler
Produces executable (.exe) files. (It can also create dynamic-link libraries or code modules).
Concatenation
The operation of joining two things together; in c# it adds two strings together with an operator.
Dependency
An object that another object relies on (for example, a member variable or parameter).
Encapsulation
Related members are treated as a single unit; external behavior is separate from internal implementation details.
Function
A series of statements that perform a logical operation or set of operations. 
Generalization
The equivalent of an inheritance relationship in object-oriented terms (an "is-a" relationship).
IDE
Software that allows you to write, compile, and debug as you develop applications.
Identifier
Names programmers choose (such as for classes, methods, and variables).
Instance
A specific object instantiated from a class.
Literal
A primitive piece of data.
Object
An instance of a class.
Polymorphism
Multiple classes used interchangeably; each class implements the same properties or methods in different ways.
Pseudocode
A set of instructions in plain English. It does not use any language-specific syntax and is easily understood.
Recursion
Something defined in terms of itself (or its type); in code, a structure that calls itself can have this.
Ternary Operator
An operator that works on three operands.
